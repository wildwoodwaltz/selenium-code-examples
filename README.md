# Selenium Automation

This repository contains a Selenium automation project that allows you to automate interactions with web browsers. Selenium is a powerful tool for automating web browsers, and can be used for tasks such as web scraping, testing web applications, and automating repetitive tasks.

## Prerequisites

- [Python](https://www.python.org/) (version 3.6 or higher)
- [Selenium](https://pypi.org/project/selenium/) (latest version)
- A web driver for the browser you want to use (e.g. [ChromeDriver](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads) for Chrome, [GeckoDriver](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases) for Firefox)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/[username]/selenium-automation.git
```

2. Install the required Python packages:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Download and install the appropriate web driver for your browser. Make sure that the web driver is in your system's PATH.

## Usage

1. Open example.py in an editor and configure the script to suit your needs.
2. Run the script:

```
python example.py
```

## Example
```py
from selenium import webdriver

# create a new browser instance
driver = webdriver.Chrome()

# navigate to a website
driver.get("https://www.google.com")

# print the page title
print(driver.title)

# close the browser
driver.quit()
```
This script will open a Chrome browser, navigate to google.com, print the title of the page, and then close the browser.
